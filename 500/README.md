# 500 How would you like to create diagrams and documentation?

You now have a choice of how you would like to create the software architecture model in your workspace. Structurizr lets you create a software architecture model using code or text (via the JSON-based web API), or with our browser-based UI (recommended for non-programmers, and smaller software architecture models).
