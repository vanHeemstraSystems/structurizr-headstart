# 400 Create a new workspace

Next, create a new workspace by clicking the Create a new workspace link on your dashboard. This will create a new empty workspace, which will be used to store your software architecture model. We recommend that a workspace contains the model, views and documentation for a single software system. See [Usage recommendations](https://structurizr.com/help/usage-recommendations) for more details.
