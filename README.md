# Structurizr - Headstart

Based on "Getting Started" at https://structurizr.com/help/getting-started

## 100 Read about the C4 model

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

Structurizr is specifically designed to support the C4 model for visualising software architecture, so you'll need some basic understanding of this.

## 200 Sign up for a free account

See [README.md](./200/README.md)

Before you can do anything, you will need to sign up for a free Structurizr account using the sign up page.

## 300 Sign in

See [README.md](./300/README.md)

Once you've signed up for an account, you can sign in to get to your dashboard.

## 400 Create a new workspace

See [README.md](./400/README.md)

Next, create a new workspace by clicking the  Create a new workspace link on your dashboard. This will create a new empty workspace, which will be used to store your software architecture model. We recommend that a workspace contains the model, views and documentation for a single software system. See Usage recommendations for more details.

## 500 How would you like to create diagrams and documentation?

See [README.md](./500/README.md)

You now have a choice of how you would like to create the software architecture model in your workspace. Structurizr lets you create a software architecture model using code or text (via the JSON-based web API), or with our browser-based UI (recommended for non-programmers, and smaller software architecture models).
